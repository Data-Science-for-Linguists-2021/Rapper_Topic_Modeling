# Progress Report

## Log 1: February 17, 2021
  This week I created my GitHub repository which consists of my `README` file that
includes my name, project title, and a brief summary. I also added a `LICENSE` file
that is essentially blank and will be specified later. I have added a `private` file
that will include notes on **Topic Modelling** and put that directories in my
`.gitignore` file, as instructed. I have also added the `progress_report` file
(which is the current file). Lastly, I polished up my project_ideas file from
the previous assignment and fashioned it into my `project_plan`. I added
rephrasing of some sections, as well as, added some links about Topic Modelling
and an example of usage of *John Miller's LyricGenius* code.
