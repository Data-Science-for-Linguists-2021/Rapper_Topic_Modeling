# Progress Report

## Log 1: February 17, 2021
  This week I created my GitHub repository which consists of my `README` file that
includes my name, project title, and a brief summary. I also added a `LICENSE` file
that is essentially blank and will be specified later. I have added a `private` file
that will include notes on **Topic Modelling** and put that directories in my
`.gitignore` file, as instructed. I have also added the `progress_report` file
(which is the current file). Lastly, I polished up my project_ideas file from
the previous assignment and fashioned it into my `project_plan`. I added
rephrasing of some sections, as well as, added some links about Topic Modelling
and an example of usage of *John Miller's LyricGenius* code.

I reviewed the Terms of Service of Genius to make sure I can use the lyrics for my particular project. I was confused by some of the terminology in it regaring licencing to use the data. I have a feeling that is is just associated with trying to alter what is on their website and not general scraping. However, I e-mailed Lauren Collister to make sure I am in the right before I proceed and am currently waiting on a response from her before I create my Genius API account so that I can proceed with scraping. I'm fairly sure it is fine to scrape for my purposes especially since I am not the only one to do a project such as this using their data. Once I receive the go ahead, I will begin to craft my own License which will be pretty open with directions like previous projects that I have referred to.
