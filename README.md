## What Y'all Sellin Ova There?: The Black Experience Commodified in Rap Lyrics

The project will look into prominent Black American Rap artists and take a dive into what these rappers are saying in their music lyrics, including but not limited to, thematic representations or specific words. I want to look at what they are saying in their song and if it corresponds with how popular the song is on Billboard charts.
